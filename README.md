Implementing On-Page SEO in an Angular application involves several steps to ensure your content is well-optimized for search engines. Since Angular applications are Single Page Applications (SPAs) and dynamically load content, there are specific challenges, particularly with search engines indexing content properly. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to optimize your Angular app for On-Page SEO.
Add Angular Universal:

Use Angular CLI to add Angular Universal to your project:
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine
This will configure your project to use server-side rendering (SSR).
Build and Serve the Application:

Build your Angular Universal app using:
npm run build:ssr

Serve the application:
npm run serve:ssr

This will render your pages on the server, making them more SEO-friendly.
